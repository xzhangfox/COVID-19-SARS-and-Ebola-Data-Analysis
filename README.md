# Motivation
When I saw covid-19 starting to spread in Washington state in February, I am worried every day about the new coronavirus outbreak and the lack of awareness of protection in the United States. <br>
As a Chinese, I know what has happened in China in January and February. China is recovring right in March but it paid huge. I know the reason of China's recovering was that the whole country was on high alert and everyone attached great importance to epidemic prevention.
But it is happening again. The United States in March, like China at the start of the outbreak, is not taking it seriously. People didn't realize the seriousness until the death rate rose. I don’t want the people to suffered again.I hope to pass on the severity of the new coronavirus and help people live safely during the outbreak.
So I started this data research project on COVID-19. Through data visualization, people's awareness of self-protection is aroused, and they hope to find more directions for the solution of covid-19 from previous outbreak cases.
# Requirements
* Python 2.7/3.7
* Visual Stidio Code
* Tableau
# Goals
### Visualization
I am going to visualize epidemic data in many aspects. The information carried by the data is mined from all angles and communicated to the audience interactively. Use HTML, CSS,javascript, and design styles to capture the audience's attention. And make the expression of professional knowledge more popular and interesting.
### Modeling
For further research, I plan to build a models to analyse similarities and differences of COVID-19, SARS and Rbola data. Use the time series models to predict spread trend in the time dimension.
Use the data tools I have learned to make a contribution to the COVID-19 solution.
# Data Preprocessing

# Inspiration for Web Design
I want the homepage to be as eye-catching as possible. Then, with the introduction of striking visual effects, the severity of covid-19 was conveyed by embedding relevant literature, news, videos and charts. In terms of the interaction method, I hope to have a certain dynamic effect, so that the whole aesthetic effect is lively.
