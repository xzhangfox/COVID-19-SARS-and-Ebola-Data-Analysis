I want the homepage to be as eye-catching as possible. Then, with the introduction of striking visual effects, the severity of covid-19 was conveyed by embedding relevant literature, news, videos and charts. In terms of the interaction method, I hope to have a certain dynamic effect, so that the whole aesthetic effect is lively.
